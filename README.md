# Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machinery

This repository contains the capstone project developed during the **IBM SkillsBuild 4-Week Internship on AI & Cloud Technologies**, a joint initiative by **Edunet Foundation**, **AICTE**, and **IBM**.

The project aims to use Machine Learning to detect machinery faults in advance using real-time sensor data—reducing unplanned downtime and enabling proactive maintenance.

## Intern Details

- **Name:** Manthripragada Varsha Vardhini  
- **Institute:** Malla Reddy Engineering College (CSIT)  
- **Duration:** 15th July 2025 – 7th August 2025

## Problem Statement

The challenge is to develop a predictive maintenance model for industrial machinery using sensor data. The goal is to build a classification model that can predict different types of failures such as:

- Tool Wear  
- Heat Dissipation Failure  
- Power Failure  
- No Failure  

This will allow industries to take action **before** failures occur, saving costs and reducing machine downtime.

> **Dataset Used:** [Kaggle - Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/machinepredictive-maintenance-classification)

## Technology Stack

- **Platform:** IBM Cloud (Lite Plan)  
- **AI/ML Studio:** IBM Watsonx.ai  
- **Modeling Tool:** IBM AutoAI  
- **Programming:** Python (used internally by AutoAI)  

---

## Project Workflow

1. **Dataset Upload:** Real-world machinery sensor data uploaded from Kaggle.
2. **Model Building:** AutoAI performed preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection.
3. **Algorithm Used:** Snap Random Forest Classifier (auto-selected by Watsonx)
4. **Model Evaluation:** Accuracy, Precision, and Recall used for performance analysis.
5. **Deployment:** Best model deployed using IBM Watson Machine Learning for real-time predictions.

## Results

- The model achieved **high accuracy** in classifying machinery status and failure types.
- Real-time predictions were made possible via a deployed API in IBM Cloud.
